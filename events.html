<!--Summer FUNction-->

<!--Block Meetings-->
<h2 class="event">Block Meetings</h2>
  <p class="eventdes">Block meetings are an opportunity for students to meet in person, at 2 or 3 regions in the North Central District. Presentations
    for these meetings are at the discretion of each district council. There is usually some sort of joint programming, as well as organization-specific 
    topics. These meetings give Brothers and Sisters in the North Central District to come together for a day of student-led workshops and fellowship.

    Current practice for host selection is by rotation, a list that is maintained by the joint district councils. Potential hosts are contacted by the District Presidents
    shortly after the summer council meeting (typically held in June). 
  </p>

<!--Disitrct Convention-->
<h2 class="event">District Convention</h2>
<p class="eventdes"> District convention is the pinnacle of events during the academic year. This weekend-long event gives Brothers and Sisters of the
  North Central District the opportunity to gather for workshops, networking opportunities, performances of the Ritual, and celebration of the completion
  of another successful year of service and musicianship. Frequently, there are National Council members representing both the Sorority and Fraternity,
  as well as other distinguished guests, keynote speakers, and alumni members providing meaningful and engaging workshops for attendees. 
  <br>
  <br>
  In the pre-Covid years, the North Central District was home to the <b>only</b> district-level intercollegiate band, the North Central District Intercollegiate
   Band (NCDIB). Under the watchful eye of the NCDIB Coordinator, Amy Heavilin (Life Member and Honorary Member of Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma), 
   the NCDIB has grown to be one of the most anticipated moments of district convention.

</p>

<!--National Convention-->
<h2 class="event" >National Convention</h2>
  <p class="eventdes">The Kappa Kappa Psi & Tau Beta Sigma National Convention, held every two years, is an opportune time to share ideas and 
    foster new ones, as well as strengthening the bonds of brotherhood and sisterhood. Brothers and sisters have the opportunity to direct the future 
    of the Fraternity and the Sorority through voting for new national leadership, participating in various workshops, and serving on a number of committees.
     The 2023 National Convention will be held in Orlando, Florida. 
     <br>
     <br>
     One of the most exciting and worthwhile programs that Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma put on each biennium is the National Intercollegiate Band. 
     The NIB has been in existence for over 75 years and its success is due to the countless number of students who audition as well as the guest 
     conductors who have participated over the years. The Kappa Kappa Psi & Tau Beta Sigma Commissioning Program, which has provided the NIB and 
     the music community with many outstanding pieces of music, is the longest running program of its kind in the world. The biennial performance of the
      National Intercollegiate Band is one of the highlights of the National Convention.
      <br>
